==========================
NumPy 1.15.0 Release Notes
==========================


Highlights
==========


New functions
=============

* `np.gcd` and `np.lcm`, to compute the greatest common divisor and least
  common multiple.
* `np.ma.stack`, the `np.stack` array-joining function generalized to masked
  arrays.


Deprecations
============

* Aliases of builtin `pickle` functions are deprecated, in favor of their
  unaliased ``pickle.<func>`` names:

  * `np.loads`
  * `np.core.numeric.load`
  * `np.core.numeric.loads`
  * `np.ma.loads`, `np.ma.dumps`
  * `np.ma.load`, `np.ma.dump` - these functions already failed on python 3,
    when called with a string.


Future Changes
==============


Compatibility notes
===================


C API changes
=============


New Features
============

``np.gcd`` and ``np.lcm`` ufuncs added for integer and objects types
--------------------------------------------------------------------
These compute the greatest common divisor, and lowest common multiple,
respectively. These work on all the numpy integer types, as well as the
builtin arbitrary-precision `Decimal` and `long` types.


Improvements
============

``histogram`` and ``histogramdd` functions have moved to ``np.lib.histograms``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These were originally found in ``np.lib.function_base``. They are still
available under their un-scoped ``np.histogram(dd)`` names, and
to maintain compatibility, aliased at ``np.lib.function_base.histogram(dd)``.

Code that does ``from np.lib.function_base import *`` will need to be updated
with the new location, and should consider not using ``import *`` in future.

``histogram`` will accept NaN values when explicit bins are given
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Previously it would fail when trying to compute a finite range for the data.
Since the range is ignored anyway when the bins are given explcitly, this error
was needless.

Note that calling `histogram` on NaN values continues to raise the
`RuntimeWarning`s typical of working with nan values, which can be silenced
as usual with `errstate`.

``histogram`` works on datetime types, when explicit bin edges are given
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dates, times, and timedeltas can now be histogrammed. The bin edges must be
passed explicitly, and are not yet computed automatically.

``np.r_`` works with 0d arrays, and ``np.ma.mr_` works with ``np.ma.masked``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0d arrays passed to the `r_` and `mr_` concatenation helpers are now treated as
though they are arrays of length 1. Previously, passing these was an error.
As a result, ``np.ma.mr_`` now works correctly on the ``masked`` constant.

``np.ptp`` accepts a ``keepdims`` argument, and extended axis tuples
--------------------------------------------------------------------
``np.ptp`` (peak-to-peak) can now work over multiple axes, just like `max` and
`min`.

``MaskedArray.astype`` now is identical to ``ndarray.astype``
-------------------------------------------------------------
This means it takes all the same arguments, making more code written for
ndarray work for masked array too.

Different C integer types of the same size have unique names
------------------------------------------------------------
Depending on platform, two of ``np.intc``, ``np.int_``, and ``np.longlong``
would previously appear indistinguishable in the ``repr`` of dtypes, despite
having different ``dtype`` attributes. These now always print with a unique
name.

Enable AVX2/AVX512 at compile time
-------------------------------------------------------------
Change to simd.inc.src to use AVX2 or AVX512 at compile time. Solving the gap
that if compile numpy for avx2 (or 512) with -march=native, still get the SSE
code for the simd functions even though rest of the code gets AVX2.
