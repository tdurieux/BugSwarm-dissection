# Things to ignore:
#   E251: spaces around default arg value (against our style)
#   E128: continuation line under-indented (too noisy)
#   F401: unused identifiers (useless, as it doesn't see inside # type: comments)
#   W601: has_key() deprecated (false positives)
#   E701: multiple statements on one line (colon) (we use this for classes with empty body)
#   W503: line break before binary operator
#   E704: multiple statements on one line (def)
#   E402: module level import not at top of file
#   B3??: Python 3 compatibility warnings
#   B006: use of mutable defaults in function signatures
#   B007: Loop control variable not used within the loop body.
