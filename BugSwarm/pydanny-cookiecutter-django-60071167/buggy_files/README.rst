Usage
------

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get cookiecutter_ to do all the work.

First, get cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django.git

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create a Django project for you.


**Warning**: After this point, change 'Daniel Greenfeld', 'pydanny', etc to your own information.

It prompts you for questions. Answer them::

    repo_name (default is "Reddit_Clone")? reddit
    author_name (default is "Your Name")? Daniel Greenfeld
    email (default is "Your email")? pydanny@gmail.com
    description (default is "A short description of the project.")? A reddit clone.
    domain_name (default is "example.com")? myreddit.com
    version (default is "0.1.0")? 0.0.1
    timezone (default is "UTC")?
    now (default is "2015/01/13")? 2015/01/16
    year (default is "2015")?


Enter the project and take a look around::

    $ cd redditclone/
    $ ls

Create a GitHub repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:pydanny/redditclone.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?

Getting up and running
----------------------

The steps below will get you up and running with a local development environment. We assume you have the following installed:

* pip
* virtualenv
* PostgreSQL

First make sure to create and activate a virtualenv_, then open a terminal at the project root and install the requirements for local development::

    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt

.. _virtualenv: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

Then, create a PostgreSQL database and add the database configuration using the  ``dj-database-url`` app pattern: ``postgres://db_owner:password@dbserver_ip:port/db_name`` either:

* in the ``config.settings.common.py`` setting file,
* or in the environment variable ``DATABASE_URL``


You can now run the usual Django ``migrate`` and ``runserver`` command::

    $ python manage.py migrate

    $ python manage.py runserver


**Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation**

If you'd like to take advantage of live reloading and Sass / Compass CSS compilation you can do so with the included Grunt task.

Make sure that nodejs_ is installed. Then in the project root run::

    $ npm install

.. _nodejs: http://nodejs.org/download/

Now you just need::

    $ grunt serve

The base app will now run as it would with the usual ``manage.py runserver`` but with live reloading and Sass compilation enabled.

To get live reloading to work you'll probably need to install an `appropriate browser extension`_

.. _appropriate browser extension: http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-

It's time to write the code!!!

"Your Stuff"
-------------

Scattered throughout the Python and HTML of this project are places marked with "your stuff". This is where third-party libraries are to be integrated with your project.
