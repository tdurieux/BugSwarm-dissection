/**
 * Manages reuse of HTTP and SPDY connections for reduced network latency. HTTP
 * requests that share the same {@link com.squareup.okhttp.Address} may share a
 * {@link Connection}. This class implements the policy of which connections to
 * keep open for future use.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getDefault() system-wide default} uses system properties for
 * tuning parameters:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code http.keepAlive} true if HTTP and SPDY connections should be
 *         pooled at all. Default is true.
 *     <li>{@code http.maxConnections} maximum number of idle connections to
 *         each to keep in the pool. Default is 5.
 *     <li>{@code http.keepAliveDuration} Time in milliseconds to keep the
 *         connection alive in the pool before closing it. Default is 5 minutes.
 *         This property isn't used by {@code HttpURLConnection}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The default instance <i>doesn't</i> adjust its configuration as system
 * properties are changed. This assumes that the applications that set these
 * parameters do so before making HTTP connections, and that this class is
 * initialized lazily.
