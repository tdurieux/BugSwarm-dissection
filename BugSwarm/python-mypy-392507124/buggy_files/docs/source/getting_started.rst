Getting started
===============

This chapter introduces some core concepts of mypy, including function
annotations, the ``typing`` module and library stubs. Read it carefully,
as the rest of documentation may not make much sense otherwise.

Installing mypy
***************

Mypy requires Python 3.4 or later to run.  Once you've
`installed Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_,
you can install mypy using pip:

.. code-block:: text

    python3 -m pip install mypy

Note that even though you need Python 3 to run ``mypy``, type checking
Python 2 code is fully supported, as discussed later in :ref:`python2`.

Running mypy
************

You can type check a program by using the ``mypy`` tool, which is
basically a linter -- it checks your program for errors without actually
running it::

   $ mypy program.py

All errors reported by mypy are essentially warnings that you are free
to ignore, if you so wish.

.. note::

   Depending on how mypy is configured, you may have to run mypy like
   this::

     $ python3 -m mypy program.py

If you haven't added any type annotations to your program yet, you
should add some first, as mypy won't report many errors in unannotated
functions. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with type annotations --
we'll discuss them in detail in much of the rest of this guide.

Mypy supports many command line options that you can use to tweak how
mypy behaves.  They are documented in :ref:`command-line`.

Function signatures
*******************

A function without a type annotation is considered *dynamically typed* by
mypy:

.. code-block:: python

   def greeting(name):
       return 'Hello, {}'.format(name)

You can declare the signature of a function using the Python 3
annotation syntax (Python 2 is discussed later in :ref:`python2`).
This makes the function statically typed, which causes mypy to
report type errors within the function.

Here's a version of the above function that is statically typed and
will be type checked:

.. code-block:: python

   def greeting(name: str) -> str:
       return 'Hello, {}'.format(name)

Now mypy will reject the following call, since the argument has an
incompatible type:

.. code-block:: python

   def greeting(name: str) -> str:
       return 'Hello, {}'.format(name)

   greeting(b'Alice')  # Argument 1 to "greeting" has incompatible type "bytes"; expected "str"

If a function does not explicitly return a value we give the return
type as ``None``. Using a ``None`` result in a statically typed
context results in a type check error:

.. code-block:: python

   def p() -> None:
       print('hello')

   a = p()  # Error: "p" does not return a value

Arguments with default values can be annotated as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   def greeting(name: str, excited: bool = False) -> str:
       message = 'Hello, {}'.format(name)
       if excited:
           message += '!!!'
       return message

Mixing dynamic and static typing within a single file is often
useful. For example, if you are migrating existing Python code to
static typing, it may be easiest to do this incrementally, such as by
migrating a few functions at a time. Also, when prototyping a new
feature, you may decide to first implement the relevant code using
dynamic typing and only add type signatures later, when the code is
more stable.

.. code-block:: python

   def f():
       1 + 'x'  # No static type error (dynamically typed)

   def g() -> None:
       1 + 'x'  # Type check error (statically typed)

.. note::

   The earlier stages of mypy, known as the semantic analysis, may
   report errors even for dynamically typed functions. However, you
   should not rely on this, as this may change in the future.

The typing module
*****************

The ``typing`` module contains many definitions that are useful in
statically typed code. You typically use ``from ... import`` to import
them (we'll explain ``Iterable`` later in this document):

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Iterable

   def greet_all(names: Iterable[str]) -> None:
       for name in names:
           print('Hello, {}'.format(name))

For brevity, we often omit the ``typing`` import in code examples, but
mypy will give an error if you use definitions such as ``Iterable``
without first importing them.

.. _stubs-intro:

Library stubs and typeshed
**************************

Mypy uses library *stubs* to type check code interacting with library
modules, including the Python standard library. A library stub defines
a skeleton of the public interface of the library, including classes,
variables and functions, and their types. Mypy ships with stubs from
the `typeshed <https://github.com/python/typeshed>`_ project, which
contains library stubs for the Python builtins, the standard library,
and selected third-party packages.

For example, consider this code:

.. code-block:: python

  x = chr(4)

Without a library stub, mypy would have no way of inferring the type of ``x``
and checking that the argument to ``chr`` has a valid type.

Mypy complains if it can't find a stub (or a real module) for a
library module that you import. Some modules ship with stubs that mypy
can automatically find, or you can install a 3rd party module with
additional stubs (see :ref:`installed-packages` for details).  You can
also :ref:`create stubs <stub-files>` easily. We discuss ways of
silencing complaints about missing stubs in :ref:`existing-code`.

Next steps
**********

If you are in a hurry and don't want to read lots of documentation
before getting started, here are some pointers to quick learning
resources:

* Read the :ref:`mypy cheatsheet <cheat-sheet-py3>` (also for
  :ref:`Python 2 <cheat-sheet-py2>`).

* Read :ref:`existing-code` if you have a significant existing
  codebase without many type annotations.

* Read the `blog post <http://blog.zulip.org/2016/10/13/static-types-in-python-oh-mypy/>`_
  about the Zulip project's experiences with adopting mypy.

* If you prefer watching talks instead of reading, here are
  some ideas:

  * Carl Meyer:
    `Type Checked Python in the Real World <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMgmKJyWKn8>`_
    (PyCon 2018)

  * Greg Price:
    `Clearer Code at Scale: Static Types at Zulip and Dropbox <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c46YHS3RY8>`_
    (PyCon 2018)

* Look at :ref:`solutions to common issues <common_issues>` with mypy if
  you encounter problems.

* You can ask questions about mypy in the
  `mypy issue tracker <https://github.com/python/mypy/issues>`_ and
  typing `Gitter chat <https://gitter.im/python/typing>`_.

You can also continue reading this document and skip sections that
aren't relevant for you. You don't need to read sections in order.
