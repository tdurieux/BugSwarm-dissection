Landlab's Continuous-Time Stochastic (CTS) cellular automata modeling package.

Overview
--------

A CellLab CTS model implements a particular type of cellular
automaton (CA): a continuous-time stochastic CA. The approach is based on that
of Narteau et al. (2002, 2009) and Rozier and Narteau (2014). Like a normal
CA, the domain consists of a lattice of cells, each of which has a discrete
state. Unlike a conventional CA, the updating process is stochastic, and takes
place in continuous rather than discrete time. Any given pair (or "doublet")
of adjacent cell states has a certain specified probability of transition to a
different pair of states. The transition probability is given in the form of an
average *transition rate*, :math:\lambda (with dimensions of 1/T); the actual
time of transition is a random variable drawn from an exponential probability
distribution with mean :math:1/\lambda

Subclasses
----------

Landlab provides for several different lattice and connection types:
    - RasterCTS: regular raster grid with transitions between horizontal and
        vertical cell pairs
    - OrientedRasterCTS: like a RasterLCA, but different transition rates can
        be assigned to vertical and horizontal pairs. This property of
        orientation can be used, for example, to implement rules representing
        gravitational attraction, or flow of a fluid with a particular direction.
    - RasterD8CTS: like a RasterLCA, but includes diagonal as well as vertical
        and horizontal cell pairs.
    - OrientedRasterD8CTS: as above but orientation also matters.
    - HexCTS: hexagonal grid
    - OrientedHexCTS: hexagonal grid, with transition rates allowed to vary
        according to orientation.

Encoding of "states"
--------------------
As in any traditional cellular automaton model, a LandlabCellularAutomaton
contains a grid of cells ("nodes" in Landlab parlance), each of which is has a
discrete state. States are represented by integers (0, 1, ... N).

In addition, every active link has an *orientation code* and a *link state code*.
The orientation code represents the orientation of the link in space: is it
"vertical" (aligned with the y axis), "horizontal" (aligned with x), or in some
other orientation? The number of possible orientations depends on the subclass.
The base class has only one orientation code (0) (meaning "orientation doesn't
matter), but this is overridden in some of the subclasses. For example, the
OrientedRasterLCA has two orientation codes (0 and 1, for vertical and
horizontal), while the OrientedHexLCA has three (representing the three axes
in a hex-cell / triagonal grid).

Each active link also has a *link state code*. The *state* of a link refers to
its particular combination of nodes and its orientation. For example, link
state 1 refers to a link in which the tail-node has state 0, the head-node has
state 1, and the orientation code is 0. The number of possible link states is
equal to R N^2, where R is the number of orientations (1 to 3, depending on the
subclass) and N is the number of possible node states. The simplest possible
Landlab CA model would have just one orientation code and two possible cell
states, so that there are four unique link states. These would be represented by
the tuples of (tail-node state, head-node state, orientation) as follows:

    link state 0 = (0, 0, 0)
    link state 1 = (0, 1, 0)
    link state 2 = (1, 0, 0)
    link state 3 = (1, 1, 0)

Main data structures
--------------------
node_state : 1d array (x number of nodes in grid)
    Node-based grid of node-state codes. This is the grid of cell (sic) states.

link_state_dict : dictionary
    Keys are 3-element tuples that represent the cell-state pairs and
    orientation code for each possible link type; values are the corresponding
    link-state codes. Allows you to look up the link-state code corresponding
    to a particular pair of adjacent nodes with a particular orientation.

node_pair : list (x number of possible link states)
    List of 3-element tuples representing all the various link states. Allows
    you to look up the node states and orientation corresponding to a particular
    link-state ID.

event_queue : heap of Event objects
    Queue containing all future transition events, sorted by time of occurrence
    (from soonest to latest).

next_update : 1d array (x number of active links)
    Time (in the future) at which the link will undergo its next transition.
    You might notice that the update time for every scheduled transition is also
    stored in each Event object in the event queue. Why store it twice? Because
    a scheduled event might be invalidated after the event has been scheduled
    (because another transition has changed one of a link's two nodes, for
    example). The way to tell whether a scheduled event is still valid is to
    compare its time with the corresponding transition time in the *next_update*
    array. If they are different, the event is discarded.

active_link_orientation : 1d array of ints (x number of active links)
    Orientation code for each link.

link_state : 1d array of ints (x number of active links)
    State code for each link.

n_xn : 1d array of ints (x number of possible link states)
    Number of transitions ("xn" stands for "transition") from a given link
    state.

xn_to : 2d array of ints (# possible link states x max. # transitions)
    Stores the link-state code(s) to which a particular link state can
    transition. "max. # transitions" means the maximum number of transitions
    from a single state. For example, if each link state is associated with one
    and only one transition, then the maximum is 1, but if there is at least
    one link state that can have either of two different transitions, then the
    maximum would be two.

xn_rate : 2d array of floats (# possible link states x max. # transitions)
    Rate associated with each link-state transition.
