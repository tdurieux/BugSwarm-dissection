Version 0.20 (under development)
================================

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

- :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA` in Python 2 (bug fix)
- :class:`isotonic.IsotonicRegression` (bug fix)
- :class:`metrics.roc_auc_score` (bug fix)
- :class:`neural_network.BaseMultilayerPerceptron` (bug fix)
- :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor` (bug fix)
- :class:`neural_network.MLPClassifier` (bug fix)

Details are listed in the changelog below.

(While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we
cannot assure that this list is complete.)

Changelog
---------

New features
............

Classifiers and regressors

- :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
  :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` now support early stopping
  via ``n_iter_no_change``, ``validation_fraction`` and ``tol``. :issue:`7071`
  by `Raghav RV`_

- Added :class:`naive_bayes.ComplementNB`, which implements the Complement
  Naive Bayes classifier described in Rennie et al. (2003).
  By :user:`Michael A. Alcorn <airalcorn2>`.

Model evaluation

- Added the :func:`metrics.balanced_accuracy` metric and a corresponding
  ``'balanced_accuracy'`` scorer for binary classification.
  :issue:`8066` by :user:`xyguo` and :user:`Aman Dalmia <dalmia>`.

- Added the :class:`preprocessing.TransformedTargetRegressor` which transforms
  the target y before fitting a regression model. The predictions are mapped
  back to the original space via an inverse transform. :issue:`9041` by
  `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_ and :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

Enhancements
............

Classifiers and regressors

- In :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor`, method ``predict``
  is faster when using ``return_std=True`` in particular more when called
  several times in a row. :issue:`9234` by :user:`andrewww <andrewww>`
  and :user:`Minghui Liu <minghui-liu>`.

- Add `named_estimators_` parameter in
  :class:`sklearn.ensemble.voting_classifier` to access fitted
  estimators. :issue:`9157` by :user:`Herilalaina Rakotoarison <herilalaina>`.

- Add `var_smoothing` parameter in
  :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB` to give a precise control over
  variances calculation. :issue:`9681` by :user:`Dmitry Mottl <Mottl>`.

- Add `n_iter_no_change` parameter in
  :class:`neural_network.BaseMultilayerPerceptron`,
  :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor`, and
  :class:`neural_network.MLPClassifier` to give control over
  maximum number of epochs to not meet ``tol`` improvement.
  :issue:`9456` by :user:`Nicholas Nadeau <nnadeau>`.

- A parameter ``check_inverse`` was added to :class:`FunctionTransformer`
  to ensure that ``func`` and ``inverse_func`` are the inverse of each
  other.
  :issue:`9399` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

Model evaluation and meta-estimators

- A scorer based on :func:`metrics.brier_score_loss` is also available.
  :issue:`9521` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

Metrics

- :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score` now supports binary ``y_true`` other than
  ``{0, 1}`` or ``{-1, 1}``. :issue:`9828` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

Linear, kernelized and related models

- Deprecate ``random_state`` parameter in :class:`svm.OneClassSVM` as the
  underlying implementation is not random.
  :issue:`9497` by :user:`Albert Thomas <albertcthomas>`.

Bug fixes
.........

Classifiers and regressors

- Fixed a bug in :class:`isotonic.IsotonicRegression` which incorrectly
  combined weights when fitting a model to data involving points with
  identical X values.
  :issue:`9432` by :user:`Dallas Card <dallascard>`

- Fixed a bug in :class:`neural_network.BaseMultilayerPerceptron`,
  :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor`, and
  :class:`neural_network.MLPClassifier` with new ``n_iter_no_change``
  parameter now at 10 from previously hardcoded 2.
  :issue:`9456` by :user:`Nicholas Nadeau <nnadeau>`.
  
- Fixed a bug in :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor` where fitting
  quit unexpectedly early due to local minima or fluctuations.
  :issue:`9456` by :user:`Nicholas Nadeau <nnadeau>`

- Fixed a bug in :class:`naive_bayes.GaussianNB` which incorrectly raised
  error for prior list which summed to 1.
  :issue:`10005` by :user:`Gaurav Dhingra <gxyd>`.

Decomposition, manifold learning and clustering

- Fix for uninformative error in :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA`:
  now an error is raised if the number of components is larger than the
  chosen batch size. The ``n_components=None`` case was adapted accordingly.
  :issue:`6452`. By :user:`Wally Gauze <wallygauze>`.

- Fixed a bug where the ``partial_fit`` method of
  :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA` used integer division instead of float
  division on Python 2 versions. :issue:`9492` by
  :user:`James Bourbeau <jrbourbeau>`.

- Fixed a bug where the ``fit`` method of
  :class:`cluster.affinity_propagation_.AffinityPropagation` stored cluster
  centers as 3d array instead of 2d array in case of non-convergence. For the
  same class, fixed undefined and arbitrary behavior in case of training data
  where all samples had equal similarity.
  :issue:`9612`. By :user:`Jonatan Samoocha <jsamoocha>`.

- In :class:`decomposition.PCA` selecting a n_components parameter greater than
  the number of samples now raises an error.
  Similarly, the ``n_components=None`` case now selects the minimum of
  n_samples and n_features. :issue:`8484`. By :user:`Wally Gauze <wallygauze>`.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`datasets.fetch_kddcup99`, where data were not properly
  shuffled. :issue:`9731` by `Nicolas Goix`_.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`decomposition.PCA` where users will get unexpected error
  with large datasets when ``n_components='mle'`` on Python 3 versions.
  :issue:`9886` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

- Fixed a bug when setting parameters on meta-estimator, involving both a
  wrapped estimator and its parameter. :issue:`9999` by :user:`Marcus Voss
  <marcus-voss>` and `Joel Nothman`_.

Metrics

- Fixed a bug due to floating point error in :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score` with
  non-integer sample weights. :issue:`9786` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

API changes summary
-------------------

Linear, kernelized and related models

- Deprecate ``random_state`` parameter in :class:`svm.OneClassSVM` as the
  underlying implementation is not random.
  :issue:`9497` by :user:`Albert Thomas <albertcthomas>`.

Metrics

- Deprecate ``reorder`` parameter in :func:`metrics.auc` as it's no longer required
  for :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score`. Moreover using ``reorder=True`` can hide bugs
  due to floating point error in the input.
  :issue:`9851` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

Cluster

- Deprecate ``pooling_func`` unused parameter in
  :class:`cluster.AgglomerativeClustering`. :issue:`9875` by :user:`Kumar Ashutosh
  <thechargedneutron>`.
