Version 0.20 (under development)
================================

As well as a plethora of new features and enhancements, this release is the
first to be accompanied by a :ref:`glossary` developed by `Joel Nothman`_. The
glossary is a reference resource to help users and contributors become familiar
with the terminology and conventions used in Scikit-learn.

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

- :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA` in Python 2 (bug fix)
- :class:`isotonic.IsotonicRegression` (bug fix)
- :class:`linear_model.ARDRegression` (bug fix)
- :class:`linear_model.OrthogonalMatchingPursuit` (bug fix)
- :class:`metrics.roc_auc_score` (bug fix)
- :class:`metrics.roc_curve` (bug fix)
- :class:`neural_network.BaseMultilayerPerceptron` (bug fix)
- :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor` (bug fix)
- :class:`neural_network.MLPClassifier` (bug fix)

Details are listed in the changelog below.

(While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we
cannot assure that this list is complete.)

Changelog
---------

Support for Python 3.3 has been officially dropped.

New features
............

Classifiers and regressors

- :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
  :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` now support early stopping
  via ``n_iter_no_change``, ``validation_fraction`` and ``tol``. :issue:`7071`
  by `Raghav RV`_

- :class:`dummy.DummyRegressor` now has a ``return_std`` option in its 
  ``predict`` method. The returned standard deviations will be zeros.

- Added :class:`naive_bayes.ComplementNB`, which implements the Complement
  Naive Bayes classifier described in Rennie et al. (2003).
  :issue:`8190` by :user:`Michael A. Alcorn <airalcorn2>`.

- Added :class:`multioutput.RegressorChain` for multi-target
  regression. :issue:`9257` by :user:`Kumar Ashutosh <thechargedneutron>`.

Preprocessing

- Added :class:`preprocessing.CategoricalEncoder`, which allows to encode
  categorical features as a numeric array, either using a one-hot (or
  dummy) encoding scheme or by converting to ordinal integers.
  Compared to the existing :class:`OneHotEncoder`, this new class handles
  encoding of all feature types (also handles string-valued features) and
  derives the categories based on the unique values in the features instead of
  the maximum value in the features. :issue:`9151` by
  :user:`Vighnesh Birodkar <vighneshbirodkar>` and `Joris Van den Bossche`_.

- Added :class:`preprocessing.PowerTransformer`, which implements the Box-Cox
  power transformation, allowing users to map data from any distribution to a
  Gaussian distribution. This is useful as a variance-stabilizing transformation
  in situations where normality and homoscedasticity are desirable.
  :issue:`10210` by :user:`Eric Chang <ericchang00>` and
  :user:`Maniteja Nandana <maniteja123>`.

- Added the :class:`preprocessing.TransformedTargetRegressor` which transforms
  the target y before fitting a regression model. The predictions are mapped
  back to the original space via an inverse transform. :issue:`9041` by
  `Andreas Müller`_ and :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

Model evaluation

- Added the :func:`metrics.balanced_accuracy_score` metric and a corresponding
  ``'balanced_accuracy'`` scorer for binary classification.
  :issue:`8066` by :user:`xyguo` and :user:`Aman Dalmia <dalmia>`.

Decomposition, manifold learning and clustering

- :class:`cluster.AgglomerativeClustering` now supports Single Linkage
  clustering via ``linkage='single'``. :issue:`9372` by
  :user:`Leland McInnes <lmcinnes>` and :user:`Steve Astels <sastels>`.

Metrics

- Partial AUC is available via ``max_fpr`` parameter in
  :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score`. :issue:`3273` by
  :user:`Alexander Niederbühl <Alexander-N>`.

Enhancements
............

Classifiers and regressors

- In :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor`, method ``predict``
  is faster when using ``return_std=True`` in particular more when called
  several times in a row. :issue:`9234` by :user:`andrewww <andrewww>`
  and :user:`Minghui Liu <minghui-liu>`.

- Add `named_estimators_` parameter in
  :class:`ensemble.VotingClassifier` to access fitted
  estimators. :issue:`9157` by :user:`Herilalaina Rakotoarison <herilalaina>`.

- Add `var_smoothing` parameter in
  :class:`naive_bayes.GaussianNB` to give a precise control over
  variances calculation. :issue:`9681` by :user:`Dmitry Mottl <Mottl>`.

- Add `n_iter_no_change` parameter in
  :class:`neural_network.BaseMultilayerPerceptron`,
  :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor`, and
  :class:`neural_network.MLPClassifier` to give control over
  maximum number of epochs to not meet ``tol`` improvement.
  :issue:`9456` by :user:`Nicholas Nadeau <nnadeau>`.

- A parameter ``check_inverse`` was added to
  :class:`preprocessing.FunctionTransformer` to ensure that ``func`` and
  ``inverse_func`` are the inverse of each other.
  :issue:`9399` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- Add `sample_weight` parameter to the fit method of
  :class:`linear_model.BayesianRidge` for weighted linear regression.
  :issue:`10111` by :user:`Peter St. John <pstjohn>`.

- :class:`dummy.DummyClassifier` and :class:`dummy.DummyRegresssor` now
  only require X to be an object with finite length or shape.
  :issue:`9832` by :user:`Vrishank Bhardwaj <vrishank97>`.

Cluster

- :class:`cluster.KMeans`, :class:`cluster.MiniBatchKMeans` and
  :func:`cluster.k_means` passed with ``algorithm='full'`` now enforces
  row-major ordering, improving runtime.
  :issue:`10471` by :user:`Gaurav Dhingra <gxyd>`.

Datasets

- In :func:`datasets.make_blobs`, one can now pass a list to the `n_samples`
  parameter to indicate the number of samples to generate per cluster.
  :issue:`8617` by :user:`Maskani Filali Mohamed <maskani-moh>`
  and :user:`Konstantinos Katrioplas <kkatrio>`.

Preprocessing

- :class:`preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures` now supports sparse input.
  :issue:`10452` by :user:`Aman Dalmia <dalmia>` and `Joel Nothman`_.

  :issue:`9521` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

- The default of ``iid`` parameter of :class:`model_selection.GridSearchCV`
  and :class:`model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV` will change from ``True`` to
  ``False`` in version 0.22 to correspond to the standard definition of
  cross-validation, and the parameter will be removed in version 0.24
  altogether. This parameter is of greatest practical significance where the
  sizes of different test sets in cross-validation were very unequal, i.e. in
  group-based CV strategies. :issue:`9085` by :user:`Laurent Direr <ldirer>`
  and `Andreas Müller`_.

- The ``predict`` method of :class:`pipeline.Pipeline` now passes keyword
  arguments on to the pipeline's last estimator, enabling the use of parameters
  such as ``return_std`` in a pipeline with caution.
  :issue:`9304` by :user:`Breno Freitas <brenolf>`.

- Add `return_estimator` parameter in :func:`model_selection.cross_validate` to
  return estimators fitted on each split. :issue:`9686` by :user:`Aurélien Bellet
  <bellet>`.

Decomposition and manifold learning

- Speed improvements for both 'exact' and 'barnes_hut' methods in
  :class:`manifold.TSNE`. :issue:`10593` and :issue:`10610` by
  `Tom Dupre la Tour`_.

Metrics

- :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score` now supports binary ``y_true`` other than
  ``{0, 1}`` or ``{-1, 1}``. :issue:`9828` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

Linear, kernelized and related models

- Deprecate ``random_state`` parameter in :class:`svm.OneClassSVM` as the
  underlying implementation is not random.
  :issue:`9497` by :user:`Albert Thomas <albertcthomas>`.

Miscellaneous

- Add ``filename`` attribute to datasets that have a CSV file.
  :issue:`9101` by :user:`alex-33 <alex-33>`
  and :user:`Maskani Filali Mohamed <maskani-moh>`.

  combined weights when fitting a model to data involving points with
  identical X values.
  :issue:`9432` by :user:`Dallas Card <dallascard>`

- Fixed a bug in :class:`neural_network.BaseMultilayerPerceptron`,
  :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor`, and
  :class:`neural_network.MLPClassifier` with new ``n_iter_no_change``
  parameter now at 10 from previously hardcoded 2.
  :issue:`9456` by :user:`Nicholas Nadeau <nnadeau>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor` where fitting
  quit unexpectedly early due to local minima or fluctuations.
  :issue:`9456` by :user:`Nicholas Nadeau <nnadeau>`

- Fixed a bug in :class:`naive_bayes.GaussianNB` which incorrectly raised
  error for prior list which summed to 1.
  :issue:`10005` by :user:`Gaurav Dhingra <gxyd>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` where when using the
  parameter ``multi_class='multinomial'``, the ``predict_proba`` method was
  returning incorrect probabilities in the case of binary outcomes.
  :issue:`9939` by :user:`Roger Westover <rwolst>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`linear_model.OrthogonalMatchingPursuit` that was
  broken when setting ``normalize=False``.
  :issue:`10071` by `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`linear_model.ARDRegression` which caused incorrectly
  updated estimates for the standard deviation and the coefficients.
  :issue:`10153` by :user:`Jörg Döpfert <jdoepfert>`.

- Fixed a bug when fitting :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` or
  :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` with ``warm_start=True`` which
  previously raised a segmentation fault due to a non-conversion of CSC matrix
  into CSR format expected by ``decision_function``. Similarly, Fortran-ordered
  arrays are converted to C-ordered arrays in the dense case. :issue:`9991` by
  :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`neighbors.NearestNeighbors` where fitting a
  NearestNeighbors model fails when a) the distance metric used is a
  callable and b) the input to the NearestNeighbors model is sparse.
  :issue:`9579` by :user:`Thomas Kober <tttthomasssss>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`naive_bayes.MultinomialNB` which did not accept vector
  valued pseudocounts (alpha).
  :issue:`10346` by :user:`Tobias Madsen <TobiasMadsen>`

- Fixed a bug in :class:`svm.SVC` where when the argument ``kernel`` is
  unicode in Python2, the ``predict_proba`` method was raising an
  unexpected TypeError given dense inputs.
  :issue:`10412` by :user:`Jiongyan Zhang <qmick>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`tree.BaseDecisionTree` with `splitter="best"`
  where split threshold could become infinite when values in X were
  near infinite. :issue:`10536` by :user:`Jonathan Ohayon <Johayon>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`linear_model.ElasticNet` which caused the input to be
  overridden when using parameter ``copy_X=True`` and ``check_input=False``.
  :issue:`10581` by :user:`Yacine Mazari <ymazari>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`sklearn.linear_model.Lasso`
  where the coefficient had wrong shape when ``fit_intercept=False``.
  :issue:`10687` by :user:`Martin Hahn <martin-hahn>`.

Decomposition, manifold learning and clustering

- Fix for uninformative error in :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA`:
  now an error is raised if the number of components is larger than the
  chosen batch size. The ``n_components=None`` case was adapted accordingly.
  :issue:`6452`. By :user:`Wally Gauze <wallygauze>`.

- Fixed a bug where the ``partial_fit`` method of
  :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA` used integer division instead of float
  division on Python 2 versions. :issue:`9492` by
  :user:`James Bourbeau <jrbourbeau>`.

- Fixed a bug where the ``fit`` method of
  :class:`cluster.AffinityPropagation` stored cluster
  centers as 3d array instead of 2d array in case of non-convergence. For the
  same class, fixed undefined and arbitrary behavior in case of training data
  where all samples had equal similarity.
  :issue:`9612`. By :user:`Jonatan Samoocha <jsamoocha>`.

- In :class:`decomposition.PCA` selecting a n_components parameter greater than
  the number of samples now raises an error.
  Similarly, the ``n_components=None`` case now selects the minimum of
  n_samples and n_features. :issue:`8484`. By :user:`Wally Gauze <wallygauze>`.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`datasets.fetch_kddcup99`, where data were not properly
  shuffled. :issue:`9731` by `Nicolas Goix`_.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`decomposition.PCA` where users will get unexpected error
  with large datasets when ``n_components='mle'`` on Python 3 versions.
  :issue:`9886` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

- Fixed a bug when setting parameters on meta-estimator, involving both a
  wrapped estimator and its parameter. :issue:`9999` by :user:`Marcus Voss
  <marcus-voss>` and `Joel Nothman`_.

- ``k_means`` now gives a warning, if the number of distinct clusters found
  is smaller than ``n_clusters``. This may occur when the number of distinct
  points in the data set is actually smaller than the number of cluster one is
  looking for. :issue:`10059` by :user:`Christian Braune <christianbraune79>`.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`datasets.make_circles`, where no odd number of data
  points could be generated. :issue:`10037` by :user:`Christian Braune
  <christianbraune79>`_.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`cluster.spectral_clustering` where the normalization of
  the spectrum was using a division instead of a multiplication. :issue:`8129`
  by :user:`Jan Margeta <jmargeta>`, :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`,
  and :user:`Devansh D. <devanshdalal>`.

Metrics

- Fixed a bug in :func:`metrics.precision_precision_recall_fscore_support`
  when truncated `range(n_labels)` is passed as value for `labels`.
  :issue:`10377` by :user:`Gaurav Dhingra <gxyd>`.

- Fixed a bug due to floating point error in :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score` with
  non-integer sample weights. :issue:`9786` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

- Fixed a bug where :func:`metrics.roc_curve` sometimes starts on y-axis instead
  of (0, 0), which is inconsistent with the document and other implementations.
  Note that this will not influence the result from :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score`
  :issue:`10093` by :user:`alexryndin <alexryndin>`
  and :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

- Fixed a bug to avoid integer overflow. Casted product to 64 bits integer in
  :func:`mutual_info_score`.
  :issue:`9772` by :user:`Kumar Ashutosh <thechargedneutron>`.

Neighbors

- Fixed a bug so ``predict`` in :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsRegressor` can
  handle empty neighbor set when using non uniform weights. Also raises a new
  warning when no neighbors are found for samples.  :issue:`9655` by
  :user:`Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen <abjer>`.

Feature Extraction

- Fixed a bug in :func:`feature_extraction.image.extract_patches_2d` which would
  throw an exception if ``max_patches`` was greater than or equal to the number
  of all possible patches rather than simply returning the number of possible
  patches. :issue:`10100` by :user:`Varun Agrawal <varunagrawal>`

- Fixed a bug in :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`,
  :class:`feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`,
  :class:`feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer` to support 64 bit sparse
  array indexing necessary to process large datasets with more than 2·10⁹ tokens
  (words or n-grams). :issue:`9147` by :user:`Claes-Fredrik Mannby <mannby>`
  and `Roman Yurchak`_.

Utils

- :func:`utils.validation.check_array` yield a ``FutureWarning`` indicating
  that arrays of bytes/strings will be interpreted as decimal numbers
  beginning in version 0.22. :issue:`10229` by :user:`Ryan Lee <rtlee9>`

Preprocessing

- Fixed bugs in :class:`preprocessing.LabelEncoder` which would sometimes throw
  errors when ``transform`` or ``inverse_transform`` was called with empty arrays.
  :issue:`10458` by :user:`Mayur Kulkarni <maykulkarni>`.

- Fix ValueError in :class:`preprocessing.LabelEncoder` when using
  ``inverse_transform`` on unseen labels. :issue:`9816` by :user:`Charlie Newey
  <newey01c>`.

API changes summary
-------------------

Linear, kernelized and related models

- Deprecate ``random_state`` parameter in :class:`svm.OneClassSVM` as the
  underlying implementation is not random.
  :issue:`9497` by :user:`Albert Thomas <albertcthomas>`.

- Deprecate ``positive=True`` option in :class:`linear_model.Lars` as the
  underlying implementation is broken. Use :class:`linear_model.Lasso` instead.
  :issue:`9837` by `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

- ``n_iter_`` may vary from previous releases in
  :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` with ``solver='lbfgs'`` and
  :class:`linear_model.HuberRegressor`.  For Scipy <= 1.0.0, the optimizer could
  perform more than the requested maximum number of iterations. Now both
  estimators will report at most ``max_iter`` iterations even if more were
  performed. :issue:`10723` by `Joel Nothman`_.

Metrics

- Deprecate ``reorder`` parameter in :func:`metrics.auc` as it's no longer required
  for :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score`. Moreover using ``reorder=True`` can hide bugs
  due to floating point error in the input.
  :issue:`9851` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

Cluster

- Deprecate ``pooling_func`` unused parameter in
  :class:`cluster.AgglomerativeClustering`. :issue:`9875` by :user:`Kumar Ashutosh
  <thechargedneutron>`.

Imputer

- Deprecate :class:`preprocessing.Imputer` and move the corresponding module to
  :class:`impute.SimpleImputer`. :issue:`9726` by :user:`Kumar Ashutosh
  <thechargedneutron>`.

Outlier Detection models

- More consistent outlier detection API:
  Add a ``score_samples`` method in :class:`svm.OneClassSVM`,
  :class:`ensemble.IsolationForest`, :class:`neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor`,
  :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelope`. It allows to access raw score
  functions from original papers. A new ``offset_`` parameter allows to link
  ``score_samples`` and ``decision_function`` methods.
  The ``contamination`` parameter of :class:`ensemble.IsolationForest` and
  :class:`neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor` ``decision_function`` methods is used
  to define this ``offset_`` such that outliers (resp. inliers) have negative (resp.
  positive) ``decision_function`` values. By default, ``contamination`` is
  kept unchanged to 0.1 for a deprecation period. In 0.22, it will be set to "auto",
  thus using method-specific score offsets.
  In :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelope` ``decision_function`` method, the
  ``raw_values`` parameter is deprecated as the shifted Mahalanobis distance
  will be always returned in 0.22. :issue:`9015` by `Nicolas Goix`_.

Covariance

- The :func:`covariance.graph_lasso`, :class:`covariance.GraphLasso` and 
  :class:`covariance.GraphLassoCV` have been renamed to 
  :func:`covariance.graphical_lasso`, :class:`covariance.GraphicalLasso` and
  :class:`covariance.GraphicalLassoCV` respectively and will be removed in version 0.22.
  :issue:`9993` by :user:`Artiem Krinitsyn <artiemq>`

Misc

- Changed warning type from UserWarning to ConvergenceWarning for failing
  convergence in :func:`linear_model.logistic_regression_path`,
  :class:`linear_model.RANSACRegressor`, :func:`linear_model.ridge_regression`,
  :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor`,
  :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcessClassifier`,
  :func:`decomposition.fastica`, :class:`cross_decomposition.PLSCanonical`,
  :class:`cluster.AffinityPropagation`, and :class:`cluster.Birch`.
  :issue:`#10306` by :user:`Jonathan Siebert <jotasi>`.

Changes to estimator checks
---------------------------

- Allow tests in :func:`estimator_checks.check_estimator` to test functions
  that accept pairwise data.
  :issue:`9701` by :user:`Kyle Johnson <gkjohns>`

- Allow :func:`estimator_checks.check_estimator` to check that there is no
  private settings apart from parameters during estimator initialization.
  :issue:`9378` by :user:`Herilalaina Rakotoarison <herilalaina>`

- Add test :func:`estimator_checks.check_methods_subset_invariance` to check
  that estimators methods are invariant if applied to a data subset.
  :issue:`10420` by :user:`Jonathan Ohayon <Johayon>`
